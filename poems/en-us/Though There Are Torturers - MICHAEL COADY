Though There Are Torturers
Though there are torturers in the world
There are also musicians.
Though, at this moment,
Men are screaming in prisons
There are jazzmen raising storms
Of sensuous celebration
And orchestras releasing
Glories of the Spirit.
Though the image of God
Is everywhere defiled
A man in West Clare
Is playing the concertina,
The Sistine Choir is levitating
Under the dome of St Peterâ€™s
And a drunk man on the road
Is singing for no reason.
